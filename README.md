# Bio Market Website

Welcome to the Bio Market website! This user-friendly platform allows users to browse, select, and purchase organic products online with ease. It includes essential features such as user registration, product browsing by category, and shopping cart functionality. Additionally, the platform offers an admin section for product catalog management and order oversight.

In the modern world of e-commerce, security is paramount. This website has undergone rigorous testing to ensure its resilience against vulnerabilities. Using Kali Linux, security assessments were performed with tools such as OWASP ZAP for web application scanning, SQL injection testing with sqlmap, and Nmap for port scanning and vulnerability detection. The website was temporarily hosted on a free server to facilitate these tests, showcasing the necessity of robust security measures in todayâ€™s online shopping platforms.

The site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, ensuring a responsive and functional user experience.
